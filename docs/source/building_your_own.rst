Bulding Your Own
================

PyAnomaly is highly configurable and customizable, and you can easily add new firm characteristics or functions.
When you make modifications, do not change the original source directly. Rather, add new modules (files) and define subclasses if necessary.
This is because the library can be updated in the future, and if you change the original source, you will lose the changes you made when you
update the library.

If you want some of your modules to be added to PyAnomaly, please contact us.
